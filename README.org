* Game of Life
The /Game of Life/ is a no-player game, whose evolution is completely determined by the system's initial state. We have a grid of /cells/, each of which can be seen as being in one of two
possible states: alive or dead (alternatively, populated or unpopulated). We have an initial state (the /seed/ of the system), and the next configuration is determined according to the
following rules:

- any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The previous rules are applied simultaneously to every cell, at each /tick/.
