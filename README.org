* Game Of Life

For a space that is "alive" or "populated":
- each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude
- each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
- each cell with two or three neighbors survives
- for a space that is "empty", each cell with three neighbors becomes "alive"
